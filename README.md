# 🌐 DPI Dashboard

A modern web dashboard for a **C++ Multi-Threaded Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) Engine** that allows users to upload PCAP files, inspect network traffic, apply blocking rules, visualize analytics, and download the filtered PCAP.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Think of this project like an **airport security checkpoint**.

- Every packet entering the network is like a passenger entering the airport.
- The DPI Engine acts as the security officer inspecting each passenger.
- It identifies where packets are going, which application generated them, and whether they should be allowed or blocked.
- The dashboard simply provides an easy way to interact with the engine visually.

# 📖 How It Works

## Step 1 — Upload a PCAP

The user uploads a network capture (`.pcap`) file.

Think of a PCAP as a CCTV recording of everything that happened on a network.

---

## Step 2 — Choose Rules

The user can decide to block:

- Applications
- Domains
- IP Addresses

Example

```
Block:
✓ YouTube
✓ TikTok
✓ facebook.com
✓ 192.168.1.20
```

---

## Step 3 — DPI Engine Starts

The backend launches the compiled C++ engine.

The engine then:

- Reads packets
- Parses protocols
- Detects applications
- Applies blocking rules
- Generates statistics
- Creates a new filtered PCAP

---

## Step 4 — Dashboard

The frontend displays

- Total packets
- TCP / UDP packets
- Forwarded packets
- Dropped packets
- Application distribution
- Thread utilization
- Packet charts
- PDF report

---

# ▶ Running Locally

## Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

Open

```
http://localhost:5173
```

# 📦 Using the Dashboard

1. Download the demo PCAP (optional).
2. Upload a PCAP file.
3. Choose blocking rules.
4. Click **Analyze**.
5. Watch the live analysis animation.
6. Explore charts and statistics.
7. Download the filtered PCAP.
8. Export the PDF report.

# 🚀 Deployment on Render

See **[DEPLOY_RENDER.md](./DEPLOY_RENDER.md)** for the full walkthrough.

1. In Render: **New → Blueprint**, connect this repo (uses root [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml)).
2. After the first deploy, set environment variables:
   - **Backend** `CORS_ORIGIN` → your frontend URL (e.g. `https://dpi-dashboard-frontend-xxxx.onrender.com`)
   - **Frontend** `VITE_API_BASE_URL` → your backend URL (e.g. `https://dpi-dashboard-backend-xxxx.onrender.com`)
3. Redeploy the frontend with **Clear build cache** (Vite bakes the API URL at build time).
4. Commit a **Linux** engine binary as `backend/cpp/dpi_engine` — the Windows `.exe` only works locally.

**Alternative:** deploy frontend on Vercel (`frontend/` root, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your Render backend URL).
